<h5>	 Background</h5>
a.	As we all know that learning something becomes difficult if we don’t have someone to teach and guide us.<br>
b.	It is always better if we have a teacher, coach or a guide to help us with what we want to learn.<br>
c.	Though Internet provides us with a lot of Educational Sites, you can’t learn the exact thing you want to learn.<br>
d.	For example, if you are a musician and you want to play Yanni’s ‘Once Upon A Time’, you won’t be able to find a proper website or a coach to tell you the exact beats for the song.<br>
e.	Or else if you get stuck in performing a C++ program, say for in pointers program, the internet may give you a lot of pointer programs but none of them will tell you what’s exactly wrong with your program or what needs to be done.<br>
f.	There has been a lot of websites like YouTube, Tutorials Sites, etc. that only give us a gist of the subject but not the exact knowledge of it.<br>
g.	Learning by oneself is also possible but to be really good in what you are learning there may come a time when you may need the help of a guide or a teacher.<br>
h.	Maybe a Disabled child who is mentally challenged is very good in mathematics and accounting but has no teacher to teach him/her to teach him, just like Ben Affleck in the movie ‘The Accountant’. He need a teacher or a guide like Jeffrey Tambor.<br>
i.	There are many people around the globe that are good at some or the other things and feel that they should spread their gifts to other who are keen to learn, but finding students becomes a really stressful work.<br>
j.	As the saying goes “You gain more knowledge when you give it to others”.<br>
k.	But there is no proper platform for these people to spread their knowledge.<br>
l.	There are people who want to help the uneducated poor children on the streets to gain education, or a Guitarist wants to help others to play that instrument and become their Guru. <br>
m.	Professionals are always good at what they are but to show how exactly good you are you need to share and show your knowledge and talent to the outside world.<br>
n.	Just like ‘Kung Fu Panda’, though Po was a Dragon Warrior, but to truly become a true Dragon Warrior he needed to share his skills to the next generations.<br>
o.	Whether you are a student or a teacher you need a platform where you can learn and teach where there is no discrimination of people, cheap and open to all.<br>
<br>

<h5>	 Objectives</h5>
a.	We can overcome such flaws and problems if we can provide a platform for such people where they can learn as well as teach.<br>
b.	They should be able to communicate with one and another for better learning.<br>
c.	A very cheap way of learning can be provided.<br>
<br>

<h5>	Purpose and Scope</h5>
a.	The only solution to the above problem is by providing a platform to these people.<br>
b.	We can make a website that the people can login and learn whatever they want from professionals.<br>
c.	The Students can choose their desired teachers of their choice and learn from them.<br>
d.	For example you want to learn to cook a delicious Butter Chicken, you can login in our website and choose any professional cooks who are registered to our site, let say there are choices given to you like Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, Chef Harpal Singh Soki and Chef Vikas Khanna; you can choose any one of them and learn from them.<br>
e.	You can chat, share videos and audio clips and pictures and learn from their videos uploaded on the website.<br>
<br>
